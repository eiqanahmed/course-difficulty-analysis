<|endofprompt|>Dr. Davis is a new instructor, it was her first year teaching. She has improved SO much since last semester. She is actually interested in the material she is teaching and her enthusiasm reflects that. She was very helpful when asking for advice with assignments.

<|endofprompt|>Rabinowitz is kind, but very strict with theoretical answers. In essays/exams with open-ended questions, she expects one specific answer. If your argument doesn't align with hers, even if well-defended, you risk a C.

<|endofprompt|>This guy doesn't care about teaching or students at all. He finishes the class 30 minutes already entirely because he doesn't want to be there longer. Probably one of the most antisocial people I've met at UofT.

<|endofprompt|>Professor Gooch is a great professor, and managed to make me care about the ancient Greeks for almost an entire semester. He prefers to use the class time for discussion of the reading material, so make sure to read the assigned documents before class. Make wise use of the course librarian, engage with the ideas in good faith, and you'll be fine.

<|endofprompt|>Falkenheim is very knowledgeable about Chinese politics, and I wish he lectured more. The readings can be engaging, but are numerous and dense. Your participation grade is a B by default and can only go up, so just do the readings ahead of time.

<|endofprompt|>The professor is an ok lecturer, and struggles to get her points across. She had the class collectively establish the grading criteria for an assignment. On a participation grade she curved the whole class down weeks after grades went out. The final group project was unclear and I wasn't sure what the point was.
